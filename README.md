# 🌦 Weather Storytelling Dashboard  

This project is a **Weather Storytelling Dashboard** that combines **Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data cleaning & analysis, and **Power BI** for interactive data storytelling and visualization.  

The dashboard provides insights into **temperature, rainfall, sunshine, humidity, and seasonal weather patterns** across multiple years and stations.

## 🔧 Skills Demonstrated  

### 🐍 Python for Data Analysis  
- **Pandas** → Data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and aggregation  
- **Numpy** → Numerical operations for dataset preparation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), trend plots, distribution charts, heatmaps  
- **CSV Handling** → Read, clean, and export structured datasets  

### 📊 Power BI for Storytelling  
- Built an **interactive dashboard** with slicers & filters  
- Created **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)** for Avg Temperature, Total Rainfall, Avg Sunshine, and Avg Humidity  
- Designed charts for weather insights (line charts, bar charts, pie charts)  
- Implemented storytelling approach with seasonal and monthly breakdowns

## 📊 Dashboard Features  

- **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):**
  - 🌡 **Avg Temperature (°C)**
  - 🌧 **Total Rainfall (mm)**
  - ☀️ **Avg Sunshine (hours)**
  - 💧 **Avg Humidity (mm)**  

- **Visualizations:**
  - 📈 **Average Temperature by Year** (line chart)  
  - 🌧 **Total Rainfall by Month** (line chart with trend)  
  - 🌍 **Rainfall by Station** (bar chart)  
  - 📊 **Weather Categories by Season** (clustered column chart)  
  - 🥧 **Days by Weather Category** (pie chart)  
  - ☀️ **Average Sunshine by Month** (line chart)  

- **Interactive Filters:**
  - 📅 **Date Picker** (select custom date range)  
  - 📍 **Station Selector** (choose location/station)
